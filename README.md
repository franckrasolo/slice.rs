#### Improve your *trunk-based development* game with `pre-commit` and `pre-push` Git hooks!

These hooks are meant to encourage:
* committing fewer changes
* constructing a narrative through [micro commits](https://lucasr.org/2011/01/29/micro-commits/) leaving a trail of breadcrumbs
* more frequent pushes of small change sets to the default branch: `main` | `trunk`
* more frequent integration
* working at a sustainable pace

They rather tyrannically enforce ideas discussed by in
[Limbo on the Cheap](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/limbo-on-the-cheap-e4cfae840330) and work equally
well when combined with the [TCR](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) workflow.

Incremental development, also discussed in
[Elephant Carpaccio](https://web.archive.org/web/20140329231444/http://alistair.cockburn.us/Elephant+Carpaccio)
and [Elephant Carpaccio V2](https://medium.com/@matteoregazzi/elephant-carpaccio-v2-ba984640ce88), suggests
aiming for thinner and thinner slices as units of work (see *fig. 1*) that must be propagated at the earliest
opportunity to other developers and validated through a continuous integration pipeline.
